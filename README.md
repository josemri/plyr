**A minimalist, terminal-inspired music player for Android**

Built this music player because I wanted something simple with a terminal aesthetic. Streams audio from YouTube (via NewPipe Extractor, no API key required), manages local playlists, and has gesture controls for quick actions. The UI is ASCII-inspired with monospace fonts everywhere.

## features

- **YouTube streaming** — search and play any song; no API keys needed (NewPipe Extractor under the hood).
- **Local playlists** — create, edit and reorder playlists; import a playlist from a **Spotify URL** (each track is resolved to its YouTube video); **Liked Songs** saved on swipe.
- **Scan & share** — share a playing track/playlist as QR or NFC tag; scan to open it.
- **Gesture controls** — configurable left/right **swipe** actions on a song, **shake** for transport controls, device **orientation** for volume/skip.
- **Recommendations feed** — community playlist recommendations synchronized via Supabase.
- **Background playback** — Media3 (ExoPlayer) foreground service with media notification controls.

## build from source

There is a bash script in case you want to build from source; take a look at `./run.sh help` for all available commands.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/josemri/plyr.git
cd plyr
./run.sh build        # builds the debug APK
./run.sh run          # compiles, installs and launches the app on the device
./run.sh test         # runs the unit tests
```

The script mounts its own environment (Java, Android SDK) under `/tmp`, so nothing is written to your home directory. Run `./run.sh clean` to wipe everything it generates.

`chmod 600 local.properties` and keep your keystore out of the repo — no secrets are tracked.
